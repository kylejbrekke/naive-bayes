Data Set Modifications:
    - Converted all data sets from .data files to .csv files
    - Added header labels to all data sets
    - Removed index field from the glass data set
    - Converted all yes/no fields in the house votes data set to 1s and 0s

Data Cleaning Methodology:
    - Any data set with a total proportion of entries containing missing values less than or equal to 5% will have all
      entries with missing values removed from the data set
        - This applied to the 'breast-cancer-wisconsin' data set
    - Any data set with a total proportion of entries containing missing values greater than 5% will have all missing
      values imputed using Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE).
        - The only data set in this group which this applied to was the 'house-votes-84' data set, which was a binary
          set, where X_i \in {0, 1}
        - The only exception to this rule is entries which have no values, in which that entry will be removed from the
          data set.
